DOBOT M1 Pro is the second-generation intelligent collision detection SCARA robot with a built-in dynamic algorithm and operational software. It is ideal for industrial needs requiring high-speed operations. A simple design, collision detection, and hand-guided learning make M1 Pro intelligent and easily manageable.
\n
\nIn combination with grippers, suction cups, dispensers, soldering tools, optical image processing systems, etc., many tasks can be automated. The speed of up to 2000 mm/s paired with a 400 mm effective range and the repeatability of +-0.02 mm make the robot ideal for a wide range of applications and open up a multitude of possibilities.
\n
\n<strong>Fast Performance:-</strong>��?Integrated controller and robot arm design enable plug and play and save the process of connections and installing wires through a high estimated speed of joints. The maximum joints' speed ranges from 180 to 1000 degrees, making M1 Pro time-saving
\n
\n<strong>Reliability and Safety:-</strong> M1 Pro can collaborate with human operators without any safety risk. The front part of the arm is 40% narrower than the arm of a traditional industrial robotic arm. It can significantly decrease the damage to the machine, raising automation efficiency.
\n
\n<strong>Easy Operation:-</strong> M1 Pro supports wireless control on different devices with multiple programming options. When the operator turns on the free-to-drop function, the robot can easily drag and drop the arm to any position. It substantially saves time on testing and simplifies the process of programming
\n
